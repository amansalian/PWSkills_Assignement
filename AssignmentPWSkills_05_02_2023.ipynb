    "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class that has its own state and behavior. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects of that class will have.\n",
    "- For example, consider the class \"Car\". A Car has attributes such as make, model, year, color, and a method such as \"drive\" that allows it to move. In OOP terms, \"Car\" is a class, and \"make\", \"model\", \"year\", \"color\", and \"drive\" are its attributes and methods."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: This is the practice of combining data and functions into a single unit (a class) and restricting access to the inner workings of    that unit from outside code. This helps to maintain the integrity of the data and prevent accidental modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance: This is the ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. This helps to reduce code duplication and promote reuse of existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism: This is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used. This allows for more flexible and dynamic code, where different objects can respond differently to the same message or method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction: This is the practice of reducing complex systems to their essential components and interactions, and presenting them in a simplified, abstracted form. This helps to reduce complexity and make code easier to understand and maintain."

    "The __init__() function is a special method in Python that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object with default values or with the values passed as arguments while creating the object. The __init__() method allows for the object to be fully initialized as soon as it is created, so that it is ready to use immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class named \"Person\" which has attributes \"name\" and \"age\". We can define an __init__() method in the class as follows:\n",

    "In this example, the __init__() method takes two parameters name and age along with the special self parameter, which refers to the instance of the object being created. Within the __init__() method, the values of name and age are assigned to the attributes self.name and self.age, respectively. Now, when we create an object of the \"Person\" class, we can pass values for name and age as arguments and the __init__() method will be called automatically to initialize the object's attributes. For example:\n",
