    "In Python, an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an exception occurs, the program's execution is halted, and Python generates an error message to help you identify the source of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised by the programmer, by Python itself, or by third-party modules. Some common examples of exceptions include TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, and FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand your code. These errors are typically caused by typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, or other mistakes in your code's syntax. Unlike exceptions, syntax errors prevent your program from running at all, and Python will generate an error message pointing to the location of the error in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during program execution, while syntax errors occur before the program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are typically caused by problems with program logic or external factors (like user input), while syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled by the programmer using try/except blocks, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions have specific error messages associated with them that can help you identify and fix the problem, while syntax errors have more generic error messages that point to the location of the error in your code."

    "Python provides a try/except statement for catching and handling exceptions. The basic syntax of a try/except block is as follows:\n",

    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exception classes that allow you to create your own exception hierarchy, with specific error messages and behaviors tailored to your application's needs. We need custom exceptions because they can help us to better handle errors and provide more informative error messages to users.\n",

By creating a hierarchy of custom exception classes, you can also better organize your code and provide more detailed information about the cause of an error."
