    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it's important to inherit from the built-in Exception class. This is because Exception is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python, and it provides a standard interface and behavior for all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from Exception allows your custom exception to be caught by any code that catches the base Exception class or any of its subclasses. This is important for writing robust code that handles errors gracefully and provides useful feedback to users or developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, inheriting from Exception allows you to take advantage of the existing functionality of the base class, such as its ability to store and display an error message when an exception is raised. By defining your custom exception as a subclass of Exception, you can also add any additional functionality or attributes that are specific to your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using the Exception class as the base for your custom exception ensures that your code is consistent with Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms and helps to promote good coding practices."

    "Exception handling is an important part of writing robust and maintainable code in Python. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",

    "- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions: Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately. It is generally better to catch specific exceptions rather than using a broad except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use specific exception types: Use specific exception types rather than the base Exception class. This makes it easier to handle different types of errors and ensures that you are only catching the exceptions that you intend to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep the try block small: Keep the try block as small as possible to limit the scope of the exceptions that could be raised. This makes it easier to isolate and handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log exceptions: Use a logging library to log exceptions and other errors. This helps with debugging and monitoring of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the finally block for cleanup: Use the finally block to perform any necessary cleanup, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using bare except blocks: Avoid using bare except blocks, which catch all exceptions. This can make it difficult to debug errors and can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raise exceptions when appropriate: Raise exceptions when appropriate, such as when an input is invalid or when a resource is not available. This makes it easier to handle errors and can improve the maintainability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use context managers: Use context managers, such as the with statement, to ensure that resources are properly acquired and released. This can help avoid errors and improve the reliability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document exceptions: Document the exceptions that a function can raise in the function's docstring. This helps with understanding the function's behavior and can assist with debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write code that is more robust, maintainable, and reliable."
