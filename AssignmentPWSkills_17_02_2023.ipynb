    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, allowing for flexible and scalable data storage. It was designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and support high availability and horizontal scaling.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that do not use traditional tabular relations used in relational databases. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs, to organize and store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for high scalability, high availability, and handling of unstructured data. It is commonly used in web applications, big data, and real-time analytics. MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for easy modification of data models without the need for schema migrations. Additionally, MongoDB's horizontal scaling allows for the distribution of data across multiple servers to handle large amounts of data traffic."

    "Dynamic Schema: MongoDB uses a dynamic schema, which means that documents in a collection can have different fields and structures. This makes it easy to handle evolving and unstructured data, without the need for complex database migrations.\n",

    "No Joins: Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not use joins, which can be a source of performance issues in large databases. Instead, it uses embedded documents and arrays to represent complex relationships between data.\n",

    "Scalability: MongoDB's architecture is designed for horizontal scaling, which means that it can easily handle large amounts of data by distributing it across multiple servers. It also supports sharding, which allows for the partitioning of data across multiple machines.\n",

    "High Availability: MongoDB offers automatic failover and replication, which ensures that data is always available, even in the case of a server failure. It also provides a number of tools for monitoring and managing replication and sharding.\n",

    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB offers a powerful query language that supports a wide range of search and filtering capabilities. It also supports full-text search and aggregation operations, which can be used for real-time analytics and reporting.\n",

    "Ad hoc Queries: MongoDB allows users to perform ad hoc queries on data, without the need for predefined indexes. This makes it easy to explore and analyze data in real-time.\n",
